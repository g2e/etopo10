# ETOPO10
A 10 arc-minute topography model derived from ETOPO1

Want LESS topography resolution in a regional or global map
compared to ETOPO1, SRTM30, and ASTER?  Well so did I and
there was nothing to be found on the internet.  So with a
little help from GMT (http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/), I was
able to fulfill my need and decided to make this effort
widely available.  Enjoy!
